		<description><![CDATA[April - I LOVE reading your reviews!  I found out about Rabbits Reviews when I read your review on Tropical Amateurs.  I was so mesmerized by your words that it was almost better than looking at the site.  This motivated me to sign up with Rabbits Reviews.  And your other reviews are like this, too.  I almost don&#039;t even want to read a review if it wasn&#039;t written by you.  Bless you!!]]></description>
