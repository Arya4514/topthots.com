        <p>RabbitsReviews was launched in 2003 by The Rabbit, a college student, who had been a member of numerous adult websites.

More specifically, the operators of this website limit their handling of such content, and only perform the activities of transmission, storage, retrieval, hosting, and/or formatting of material that may depict sexually explicit conduct, all of which material appears on the website as the result of actions taken by third-party users of the website. All portions of the website that contain such user-generated material are under the control of the relevant user, for whom this website is provided as an online service by its operators. Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. &sect; 2257(h)(2)(B)(v) and 47 U.S.C. &sect; 230(c), the operators of this website reserve the right to delete materials appearing on the site as the result of actions taken by the website's users, which materials are deemed, in the operator's sole discretion, to be indecent, obscene, defamatory, or inconsistent with the policies and terms of service for this website.</p>

                    <li><strong>You, the User</strong> - As the User of this Site, this Terms of Service Agreement will refer to the User as "You" or through any second-person pronouns, such as "Your," or any derivation thereof. Hereinafter, the User of the Site shall be referred to in applicable second-person pronouns; or, alternatively</li>
                    <li><strong>You, the Webmaster</strong> - As a Webmaster who submits his/her website for review by the Publisher, this Terms of Service Agreement will refer to the Webmaster as "Webmaster" or, in affiliated contexts, through second-person pronouns as outlined in &para; I(A)(1)(b), above. A Webmaster is also, under the terms of this Agreement, subject to all conditions applicable to Users.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong> Consideration</strong> - Consideration for Your acquiescence to all of the provisions in this Agreement has been provided to:</li>
            <li>
                <ul>
                    <li>The User - in the form of allowing the User to access Our Site and utilize Our Services.</li>
                    <li>The Webmaster &ndash; in the form of consenting to Publisher's review of your website, and, consequently, consent to posting of Publisher's review and rating(s), and the opening of such review to User comments. Additional consideration is provided in the form of publicity, promotion and visibility generated by the Publisher's website reviews.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>You agree that such Consideration is adequate, and that it is received upon the User viewing or downloading any portion of any of the Publisher's website(s), and/or the Webmaster consenting to the review of its website(s).</p>
        <p><strong><img src="https://www.rabbitsreviews.com/images/rr4/arrow-right3.gif" alt="" width="7" height="9" /> What This Agreement Is </strong> - This Agreement is a legal contract between You and the Publisher. You should treat it as any other legal contract by reading its provisions carefully, as they will affect Your legal rights. A User accessing the Site in any manner, affirmatively agrees to be bound by all of the terms contained in this Terms of Service Agreement. Alternatively, a Webmaster consenting to Publisher's review and rating(s), affirmatively agrees to all other actions described in &sect;I(A)(2), above. You may not pick and choose which terms apply to You. If You do not agree with all of the terms in this Agreement, You must cease all access and use of the Site and/or any other services provided by the Publisher. Once access to the site is granted, agreement to all terms contained herein will be presumed.</p>
        <p><strong><img src="https://www.rabbitsreviews.com/images/rr4/arrow-right3.gif" alt="" width="7" height="9" /> Electronic Signatures / Assent Required</strong> -<span class="color-red"> No one is authorized to access this Site unless they have manifested their assent to this Agreement. Physical signatures are not necessary, since this Agreement is intended to be governed by the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (E-SIGN Act). You manifest Your agreement to this Terms of Service Agreement by taking any act demonstrating Your assent thereto. Most likely, You will click a button containing the words "I agree" or some similar syntax. You should understand that this action has the same legal effect as You placing Your physical signature on any other legal contract. If You fail to sign this Agreement, You understand that You are an unauthorized user of the Site, despite any payments or other consideration made by You. No act or omission by the Publisher should be interpreted as a waiver of the requirement that You assent to this Terms of Service Agreement. If You fail to do so, You are still bound by the terms of this Agreement by virtue of Your viewing the Site or using any portion of the Site or Publisher's services. However, if You fail to electronically sign this Agreement, You stipulate to and agree to pay the Publisher $250.00 each time You access the Site as liquidated damages for unauthorized access and use, and You agree to pay all of our costs and expenses, including Attorneys' fees and costs, incurred in collecting this unauthorized access fee from You.</span></p>
        <p><strong><img src="https://www.rabbitsreviews.com/images/rr4/arrow-right3.gif" alt="" width="7" height="9" /> Revisions to this Terms of Service Agreement</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>From time to time, We may revise this Agreement. We reserve the right to do so, and You agree that We have this unilateral right. You agree that all modifications or changes to this Agreement are in force and enforceable immediately upon posting. The updated or edited version supersedes any prior versions immediately upon posting, and the prior version is of no continuing legal effect unless the revised version specifically refers to the prior version and keeps the prior version or portions thereof in effect.</li>
            <li>We agree that if We change anything in this Agreement, We will change the "last modified date" at the top of this Agreement. You agree to periodically re-visit this web page, and to use the "refresh" button on Your browser when doing so. You agree to note the date of the last revision to this Agreement. If the "last modified" date remains unchanged from the last time You reviewed this Agreement, then You may presume that nothing in the Agreement has been changed since the last time You read it. If the "last modified" date has changed, then You can be certain that something in the Agreement has been changed. Following your notice of any modifications to this Agreement, if you do not agree to any portion of the modifications, you should terminate your use of the Site immediately. Your continued use of the Site now, or following the posting of notice of any changes to these Terms of Use, shall constitute a binding acceptance by You of these Terms of Service, or any subsequent modifications.</li>
            <li>Waiver - if You fail to periodically review this Agreement to determine if any of the terms have changed, You assume all responsibility for such omission and You agree that such failure amounts to Your affirmative waiver of Your right to review the amended terms. We are not responsible for Your neglect of Your legal rights and obligations.</li>
        </ol>

                    <li>In conjunction with &sect; V of this Agreement, Users possess the privilege of reviewing the written reviews and ratings of Webmasters submitting their Sites for Publisher's critical, impartial review.

        <p>Users should use caution and good judgment when leaving comments about a removed Site. Users could be held legally responsible for damages to a reviewed website if a court were to find that the remarks constitute libel or defamation. Pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, and under United States federal law, (Communications Decency Act &sect;230), because Publisher does not censor comments or investigate them for accuracy, Publisher is not legally responsible for the remarks that Users post, even if those remarks are defamatory. However, neither this Agreement nor federal law protect the User who leaves the comments from legal responsibility for the content of such communications. Many of these Site prohibitions are discussed in further detail herein. If the User retains any uncertainty regarding the nature of these terms, he/she has the affirmative obligation to immediately contact the Site administrator for any required clarification of rights and responsibilities under this Agreement.</p>

            <li><strong>How secure is your personal information? </strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>We take reasonable administrative, physical, and electronic measures designed to safeguard and protect your information from unauthorized access or disclosure. This includes but is not limited to storing your information in encrypted form behind a firewall designed to block access from outside our network.</p>
        <p class="border">Although we use commercially reasonable efforts to safeguard the privacy of your information, transmissions on the Internet cannot be made absolutely secure. Moreover, we cannot assure you that your personally identifiable information that we collect will not be used or disclosed inconsistently with this privacy policy. We assume no responsibility or liability for disclosure of any of your information due to errors in transmission, unauthorized third-party access, or other causes beyond our reasonable control.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>What about other websites linked to our Website?</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Third parties are under no obligation to comply with this privacy policy concerning personally identifying information that you provide directly to those third parties or that those third parties collect for themselves. We neither own nor control the third-party websites accessible through our Website. Thus, this privacy policy does not apply to information provided to or gathered by third parties that operate them. We assume no responsibility for the content or the privacy policies of any other websites that may provide links to our Website or to whom we may provide links, or for the privacy policies of any of their advertisers. Before visiting a third party website, whether by means of a link on this Website or otherwise, and before providing any personally identifying information to any third party, you should inform yourself of the privacy policies any practices (if any) of the third party responsible for that website, and should take those steps necessary to, in your discretion, protect your privacy.</p>

            <li><strong>What is "Do Not Track" and does the Website follow it?</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Do Not Track ("DNT") is a privacy preference that you can set in your Web browser. DNT is a way for you to inform websites and services that you do not want certain information about your webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services. We are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information we collect and that is why we provide you the ability to opt-out. However, we do not recognize or respond to any DNT signals as the Internet industry works toward defining exactly what DNT means, what it means to comply with DNT, and a common approach to responding to DNT.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Yes. We may amend this privacy policy, as we believe necessary or convenient to operate our Website. If we do make a change, we will use all commercially reasonable efforts to provide you with advance notice of any change by posting notice of the amended privacy policy on our Website at least 15 days before its effective date. Each version of this privacy policy will identify when we last modified it at the top of the webpage and we will keep prior versions of this privacy policy in an archive for your review. Unless we obtain your express consent, any revised privacy policy will apply only to information collected after its effective date, and not to information collected under any earlier privacy policies.
